You or your household member are covered only if you rent or borrow a car in the United States or Canada. If you are borrowing or renting any sort of truck (for example a U-Haul truck to move your belongings) please speak to your agent or your insurance company to see if you are covered.

Please refer to your auto policy selections page and policy language for the per day policy limit. The selected daily limit is the most your carrier will pay per day. Insurers are not required to provide a substitute transportation that is comparable to your auto. It depends on the agreement that you sign with the rental car company as well as the language in your own policy. You should talk to your insurance company before signing an agreement to rent a car.

Insurance companies legally have to pay all claims in a prompt and reasonable amount of time. What a ""prompt and reasonable"" amount of time is may be diﬀerent for each claim.

al Steps to Take After a Car Accident A car accident is often a stressful and perhaps even traumatic event. It can be overwhelming and confusing. You might need help with properly documenting the scene of the accident and working with the police on an accident report. It is also natural to worry that your insurance company may not cover the full costs of your injuries. Law enforcement officers may not understand what caused the accident in the first place. However, knowing what to do in the moments, days, and weeks after the accident can go a long way in aiding your recovery and also helping to ensure you receive proper compensation for the vehicle damage caused by the car accident. For these reasons, one of the best things you can do is find a reputable Massachusetts car accident lawyer. Michael Kelly Injury Lawyers can help you manage the claims process and achieve justice.

Commonwealth of Massachusetts Motor Vehicle Crash Operator Report When should I complete a Crash Report? M.G.L. Chapter 90, Section 26 requires a person who was operating a motor vehicle involved in a crash in which (i) any person was killed or (ii) injured or (iii) in which there was damage in excess of $1,000 to any one vehicle or other property, to complete and file a Crash Operator Report with the Registrar within five (5) days after such crash (unless the person is physically incapable of doing so due to incapacity). The person completing the report must also send a copy of the report to the police department having jurisdiction on the way where the crash occurred. If the operator is incapacitated but is not the vehicle’s owner, the owner is required to file the crash report within the five (5) days based on his/her knowledge and information obtained about the crash.

However, you must realize that a lawsuit is the next step from a personal injury claim. In case the insurance company rejects your claim or you can’t negotiate favorable compensation, then you can take the case to court. As for person

Commonwealth of Massachusetts Motor Vehicle Crash Operator Report When should I complete a Crash Report? M.G.L. Chapter 90, Section 26 requires a person who was operating a motor vehicle involved in a crash in which (i) any person was killed or (ii) injured or (iii) in which there was damage in excess of $1,000 to any one vehicle or other property, to complete and file a Crash Operator Report with the Registrar within five (5) days after such crash (unless the person is physically incapable of doing so due to incapacity).
