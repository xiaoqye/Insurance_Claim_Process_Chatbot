You might need help with properly documenting the scene of the accident and working with the police on an accident report. It is also natural to worry that your insurance company may not cover the full costs of your injuries. Law enforcement officers may not understand what caused the accident in the first place. However, knowing what to do in the moments, days, and weeks after the accident can go a long way in aiding your recovery and also helping to ensure you receive proper compensation for the vehicle damage caused by the car accident. For these reasons, one of the best things you can do is find a reputable Massachusetts car accident lawyer. Michael Kelly Injury Lawyers can help you manage the claims process and achieve justice.

Follow this car accident checklist for the best results. Ensure Safety After a Car Accident in Massachusetts After a car accident, your immediate priority should be to get yourself and any passengers involved to a safe location. If your motor vehicle is drivable, move it to the side of the road or another safe area away from traffic. Turn on your hazard lights — this way, you can prevent further damage and alert other drivers about the situation. Always be aware and cautious of your surroundings. Under no circumstances should you stand in the path of oncoming traffic while assessing the situation. Your safety and well-being must remain a top priority before addressing any other concerns.

Call 911 and Report the Accident Immediately Calling 911 immediately after a Boston car accident will help make sure that law enforcement officially documents the incident. Even if the accident seems minor, having a police report can be super important, especially if you are not at fault. The report provides an unbiased account of the scene, which can be key evidence when filing a car accident claim or if you need to prove the legal liability of other parties. Additionally, a police report can help simplify the claims process with your insurance company.

That’s why you should try to gather information on your own to secure your insurance claim. You should also copy down some identifying information about the other vehicle involved in the accident. Here’s a list of important details to note: Don’t Admit Fault Even if you believe you may have been the cause of the car accident, refrain from making statements regarding liability until you have had an opportunity to collect yourself. Some people will inadvertently state that they are sorry for causing the incident, although it was not their fault. Admitting fault for an auto accident, especially to the other driver or drivers involved, can complicate things greatly.

Seek Medical Attention Many car accident injuries, such as whiplash or concussions, don’t show symptoms right away. Even if you feel fine, visit a doctor promptly. Medical documentation not only protects your health but also strengthens your case. If you experience pain and/or discomfort right away or in the days and weeks following the accident, consult your primary care physician for an evaluation immediately. It’s not a bad idea to contact your doctor, even if you’re not showing immediate signs of injury. A medical professional can guide you on the best next steps. Documenting your injuries is crucial when submitting the case for settlement or presenting it to a jury.

MA004,What to Do After Car Accident in MA,MA004_C006,"ictures of Your Injuries Immediately When considering what to do after a car accident in Massachusetts, you must document any injuries as soon as possible. Clear, detailed photos can provide solid evidence of the harm you sustained during the accident. When dealing with the insurance company, these images help prove the severity of your injuries and support your claim. Here’s what you may want to capture to solidify your case: Make sure to depict these pieces of evidence from different angles and ranges. If you’re unable to take photos yourself, ask a friend or family member to assist you. Attorneys are often able to significantly increase the actual cash value of a case with the aid of pictures taken immediately after an accident.

This will also come in handy later if you decide to file a car accident claim or need to share information with an insurance adjuster. Cooperate with Emergency Personnel and Law Enforcement When you have been in a car accident, your nerves may be on edge. You may worry about how much to share and whether to keep some things to yourself. However, for all parties involved, it is best to cooperate fully with emergency medical services, the police, and anyone else on the scene who is there to help.

Your cooperation helps them provide the appropriate care and makes sure accurate information is included in the police report. Talk to Witnesses and Record Contact Information If anyone witnessed your accident, try to talk to them. Ask them what they saw and if what they observed confirms what you think happened. Ask them directly whether they are ready to be a witness and testify. Not everyone may want to be a part of a Massachusetts case, but if the response is affirmative, exchange information such as: Full name Home address Phone number Email address Urge them to stay until the police arrive. A witness’s account can provide an impartial perspective that supports your version of events, which may be very helpful when determining liability. Having a"

Reach Out to Your Insurance Company If you have followed the steps above, you will be well-prepared to contact your insurance agent and share details of your Massachusetts car accident. Gather all your notes, photos, the police report, and any other relevant evidence and provide them to the insurance provider. Regardless of the damage level, contact your insurer promptly and share all evidence you’ve gathered. A detailed report improves your chances of fair compensation.

Contact a Lawyer It is no secret that involving a Boston car accident attorney gives you the best shot at recovering a large settlement or favorable court judgment. Motor vehicle accident cases are incredibly complicated, and you will likely need help navigating the car accident claim. Insurance companies very regularly offer unrepresented individuals lowball settlements because they know they are unfamiliar with case value.

Most Lowell personal injury lawyers provide a free consultation. It is better to sit down and speak with a Massachusetts car accident lawyer and refrain from signing up with their firm than to talk to no one at all. You can get more than the insurer’s coverage if you have the support of an attorney who understands Massachusetts law and has experience in claim negotiations. What to Do After You Leave the Scene of a Car Accident in Massachusetts? Your initial steps after a car accident form the base of a successful car insurance claim. However, the work does not end there. Strengthening your case after the scene involves gathering more evidence, following up with medical providers, and staying proactive with documentation.

For instance, the evidence acquired at the scene of the accident isn’t the only proof you can present. You can obtain other relevant documents and share them with your insurance company to ensure that you recover the sustained damages and losses in full. Revisit a Doctor or Monitor for Delayed Injuries Whether you’ve been to the ER or were allowed to go home after the accident, it’s never a waste to inquire about a follow-up examination. This is especially true if you start to feel worse in the first few days after the collision. It is true that some soft tissue injuries, concussions, and internal organ damage may not manifest right away. Don’t ignore any sign or symptom that seems out of place.

Not only will the doctor assess your condition and prescribe the proper medical treatment, but they will also add weight to your claim. Keep in mind that any insurance company pays increased attention to medical timelines. Postponing the visit can compromise the compensation you seek. File a Crash Accident Report (if Police Didn’t Respond) Massachusetts law requires drivers to submit a Motor Vehicle Crash Operator Report within 5 days if there were injuries, a fatality, or damage exceeding $1,000. A copy must be sent to the local police and your insurer. According to this report, a driver or owner of a car involved in a collision that results in personal injuries, property damage exceeding $ 1,000, or a fatal outcome must notify the Registrar about the incident. Moreover, a copy of the report should also be sent to the police department responsib"

Moreover, a copy of the report should also be sent to the police department responsible for the area where the accident occurred, as well as the sender’s insurance company. Some accident victims falsely assume that a police report is an all-encompassing record. But it is not. While the police note down the time, location, potential causes, and related factors that may have contributed to the event, the crash accident report is a self-filed form required by law. Follow Up with a Car Accident Attorney if You Haven’t Yet If, in the chaos following the accident, you failed to reach out to a trained legal representative, it is high time you did so, at the very least, for a free consultation.

As you share the details of the incident with a lawyer, they will assess the situation on a deeper level and advise you on whether the insurance hassle is worth the effort. A trained law expert can notice potential future expenses and optimize the settlement calculations so that you don’t lose anything in the insurance claim process. Keep in mind that many law firms, such as Michael Kelly Injury Lawyers, work on a no-win, no-fee basis. This means that you won’t have to pay for legal services until you win the case. Provide Additional Info to Your Insurer You’ll be surprised at how many things happened in the first days and weeks after the accident.

Often, injured parties are unaware that a timer is assigned to every car accident lawsuit. The state of Massachusetts has a legal deadline for personal injury cases, which is three years from the day of the incident. There may be some shifts in the timeframe, depending on the parties involved in the crash and the unique consequences. Therefore, it is always best to discuss these matters with a local attorney experienced in the intricacies and nuances of the legal system. However, you must realize that a lawsuit is the next step from a personal injury claim.

As for personal injury claims, the deadline for submission is usually outlined in the insurance policy of the provider you are filing against. Some insurance providers may have stricter timeframes than others, so you shouldn’t postpone the process for too long. It is advised to carry on with the claim in the first few days after the accident. Practical Car Accident Tips Listen to Your Body Pay attention to any delayed pain, stiffness, or headaches, and don’t ignore symptoms that could indicate a more serious injury.

Keep Receipts Out-of-pocket expenses used to further your treatment may be considered as damages (e.g., Uber, Lyft, mileage, gas receipts, etc.). Doctors’ Notes If you need to miss work due to your injury or treatment, always obtain a doctor’s note that identifies your full or partial disability (either from your primary care physician or the treating provider) and save a copy for your attorney.

Failing to ﬁle when required may result in penalties, including license suspension. Even if the police responded to the accident and ﬁled their own report, that does not exempt you from your individual reporting obligation. How to File a Massachusetts Crash Report The Motor Vehicle Crash Operator Report can be downloaded from the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) website.

What to Include in the Report To ensure accuracy and avoid complications later, include as much detailed information as possible. Your report should cover: Date, time, and location of the crash Contact and insurance information for all involved drivers Vehicle makes, models, and license plate numbers A detailed narrative of what happened Weather, road, and trafﬁc conditions Injuries sustained by anyone involved Any witnesses' names and contact information Avoid speculating or assigning blame in your written statement.

How Accident Reports Impact Insurance and Legal Claims In no-fault cases, your insurer will primarily look at your own policy coverage.

If you give false information to your insurer about how the accident happened, or when, your claim may be denied. There are no speciﬁc time limits for the settlement of claims. Insurance companies legally have to pay all claims in a prompt and reasonable amount of time. What a ""prompt and reasonable"" amount of time is may be diﬀerent for each claim. Some claims that need a more thorough investigation may take longer to ﬁgure out. For example, bad weather often causes more claims to be ﬁled.

Yes, if you have comprehensive coverage on your auto policy you are covered for the loss after you pay the amount of any glass deductible you chose. While many companies default to having no glass deductible, a glass deductible is permissible in Massachusetts. Having a glass deductible usually decreases the cost of Comprehensive coverage and generally makes the overall cost of the policy lower. However, this means you will be responsible for paying for the repair or replacement of your windshield up to your deductible, which may end up being the full cost. If the damage to your car aﬀects how it can be driven safely, the insurance company will pay to repair it with an OEM part. For non-safety parts, unless your claim occurs during the ﬁrst 20,000 miles on the auto's odometer, the insurance company does not have to pay for OEM parts. For autos with more"

You can insist on OEM parts, but you will have to pay the diﬀerence in cost. Massachusetts Consumer Guide: Mechanics of Auto Repair The insurance company has to pay the storage charges until it makes a reasonable oﬀer to settle your claim. If you dispute the amount of money oﬀered by the company and the company changes its oﬀer, this does not necessarily mean that the ﬁrst oﬀer was unreasonable. If you and your company disagree over what is reasonable, your policy has a process you can follow to work out the disagreement.

It is important that you work with the company and stay in communication with them, even if you are in the middle of a dispute. If the company makes you a reasonable oﬀer and you don’t respond, you could be responsible for the storage fees if you leave your vehicle in storage. Personal cars used for business, like for delivering pizza and ride sharing (such as Uber and Lyft) aren’t covered under a personal auto policy. You should always tell your agent or insurance company about your plans to start driving for a ride share company as you will likely need excess coverage for when your vehicle is being used for business purposes.

If you are borrowing or renting any sort of truck (for example a U-Haul truck to move your belongings) please speak to your agent or your insurance company to see if you are covered. You are likely not covered if you rent or borrow a truck. If you are found not at fault for the accident, you can open a third party claim with the at fault party’s policy under Part 4 (Damage to Someone Else’s Property).

Insurers are not required to provide a substitute transportation that is comparable to your auto. It depends on the agreement that you sign with the rental car company as well as the language in your own policy. You should talk to your insurance company before signing an agreement to rent a car. Keep in mind that your credit card might also oﬀer some insurance coverage for rental cars if you use your card to pay for the rental. Again, you should discuss with your insurance company about whether any coverage provided via your credit card company is primary, secondary or excess. If your vehicle is declared a total loss "

If your vehicle is declared a total loss this means that the cost to repair the car exceeds the current value/worth of the vehicle. When your vehicle is a total loss, your insurance company will pay you only the “actual cash value” of the vehicle as of the date of the accident, not the cost to replace it. Your vehicle's value is determined by the following factors: the retail value for a vehicle of a similar type (also known as a “like kind”) and condition before the accident; and the price you paid for the vehicle plus the value of any improvements that had been made to the car. Your company also considers if your vehicle is worth less because of damage that happened to the vehicle before the accident which the appraiser ﬁnds or for which a claim has been paid; and how much it wo"

If your vehicle has a high value because of its great condition such as an antique, classic, or restored auto, you should have it appraised and then insure it for the amount the appraisal says the vehicle is worth. Insurance companies can pick their own sources form which they derive their “total loss equations” from, such as NADA and Kelly Blue Book, and you have the right to ask the insurance company for their sources. If you disagree with the amount the company is oﬀering, you can attempt to negotiate, but remember, the vehicle has to be of like kind and quality.

Typically, if the insurer has made an oﬀer to you to settle your claim for the total loss of your car, the insurer may stop paying for the rental car. If you disagree with the total loss amount being oﬀered, you may attempt to negotiate with the insurer for a greater settlement amount by providing supporting documentation which supports your claim that the actual cash value of your vehicle is greater than the amount being oﬀered by the insurer. However, the insurer is not obligated to continue to pay for the rental car following an oﬀer to settle your claim.

If you don't have your license plates because your auto was stolen or because your auto and plates were destroyed in a ﬁre, you must go to the nearest Registry of Motor Vehicles oﬃce and get a lost or stolen plates receipt.

If you have a Waiver of Deductible Endorsement added on your policy and meet the criteria as outlined in the endorsement your company will waive your deductible if certain requirements are met.

However, the deductible would not be waived if the operator of your covered auto under this Part was also convicted of one of the violations. 4.

Typically, insurers use either the 2008 standard policy, the 2016 standard policy or their own proprietary policy as approved by the Division of Insurance. In October 2021, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) issued a decision saying for the ﬁrst time that the diminished value caused to your vehicle by a collision with another vehicle may be recoverable from the at-fault party for claims ﬁled involving the 2008 edition of the Standard Massachusetts Automobile Insurance Policy. If you are in an accident and the at-fault party has a Massachusetts policy that is based on the 2008 edition of the Standard Massachusetts Automobile Insurance Policy, you may be able to recover for the diminished value caused to your motor vehicle if you can establish such damages.

The SJC ruling stated that when making a claim against the other driver’s policy, the burden of proof is on the claimant to show that (i) a vehicle suﬀered diminished value even after being fully repaired, and (ii) the amount of any such damages. However, in January 2025, the SJC further ruled that if the policy is based on the 2016 Standard Massachusetts Automobile Insurance Policy the insurance company is not required to cover claims for inherent diminished value arising from an accident caused by an at-fault 3rd party, but the party who is at-fault for the accident could be held responsible for inherent diminished value, if the inherent diminished value can be independently established.
